/*
Approach:  
A cell in 2D matrix can be connected to at most 8 neighbours.
So in Depth First Search, make recursive calls for 8 neighbours of that cell.
Keep a visited Hash-map to keep track of all visited cells.
Also keep track of the visited 1â€™s in every DFS and update maximum length region.

Take a 4*4 2D matrix from the user.

Define L_Region, a function to find the length of the largest region in the matrix.
If a cell with value 1 is not visited yet, then new region found and call DFS on it.
Store maximum region in result and return it.

Define DFS, a function to implement Depth First Search.
Use two static arrays to store the directions of the 8 neighbours.
If cells are visted then mark them as visited.
Recurr for all the neighbours and increment the length of the region.

Define Is_Safe, a function to check if a cell is safe to be included in the region.
